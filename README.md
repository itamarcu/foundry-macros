# Shem's Foundry Macros
A collection of my Foundry VTT macros.

Some of these macros have arguments; these macros are meant to be used with the Furnace module, that allows macros to be
 called from other macros. Some others have dependencies, which means that they require these other macros to be
 created and added to your macro directory, named the same way as they are here.

Select one or more tokens to be the turners. Target one token to be the target.
Whenever the turner or the target move, the turner will rotate to face the target.
